<!--Put description here:-->
The Drone Ranger was the Fall 2018-Spring 2019 game! It was challenging for us this year, as we were mostly new members of SIGGD, but we made a fun game that we're all proud of.

The goal is to fight your way past bandits and robots, and save the future! The further you go, the better weapons you'll come across, improving your futuristic arsenal.

Draw! And do your best to fight your way through this wild-west/sci-fi game!
