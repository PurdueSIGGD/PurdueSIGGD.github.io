20,000 Leagues Over the Sea is SIGGD and GDU's project for the Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 semester. Drawing from a wonderful mix between the earlier classics of Missile Defense and Asteroids, 20,000 Leagues Over the Sea revolves around using orbital mechanics to defend a planet from invading aliens. The game was developed with the Unity Game Engine, presented in a top-down 2.5D perspective.
