<!--Put description here:-->
Grappling hook fighters was a game inflenced by games like Duck Game and Super Smash Bros. Including multiple various gameplay elements with a fast paced mechanic that keeps you on your toes, you can face off up to 4 other players at once and fight for glory!

Each player starts with nothing but their fists and their trusty grapple hook, and they have to look for powerups and weapons to help get an upper edge against their opponents.

There are 30 different combinations of players and colors you can choose from, and the game also supports multiple-mouse inputs. Each player gets their keys on the keyboard to use, and can plug in their own mouse to use individually!
