<!--Put description here:-->
Within the Darkness was created to showcase all of our work for the 2011-2012 school year. WTD brings our work in the Mirror Engine and the Oceanland Level Editor to life together with our game programming team. From our distinctive way of lighting to giant blobs, our game gives a taste of our retro style here at SIGGD Purdue as well as an excellent demonstration of what our team is capable of creating.
