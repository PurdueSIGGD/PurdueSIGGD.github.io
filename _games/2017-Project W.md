<!--Put description here:-->
Project W was the Fall 2017-Spring 2018 game! It was our first challenge implementing a multiplayer and server hosting mechanic, as well as experimenting with various visual effects.

Players can choose their preferred wizard types, each possessing different attributes and skills, to fight against each other in free-for-all round or deathmatch. Player or team with the highest points wins.

Get your friends to join you on epic and hilarious spell battles!
