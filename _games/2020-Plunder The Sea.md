<!--Put description here:-->
Plunder the Sea was the Fall 2020-Spring 2021 game! With the pandemic going on during this year, we developed the game almost entirely remotely, but we ended up creating an exciting game with lots of surprise.

Your goal is to get as far as you can through the different randomly-generated dungeon levels. As you collect bait from slain enemies, you can use that to fish (which is completed through a DDR rhythm mechanic) and you gain long- and short- term buffs by successfully catching them. You can also use bait to purchase new weapons, or use your class' ultimate abiltiies. There are many different kinds of enemies and weapons to be found!

Set sail to a new adventure that will challenge your reflexes, strategy, and long-term planning!
