<!--Put description here:-->
Our project for the Spring 2013 semester. Turn based strategy game involving packs of animals fighting for survival on a battlefield of randomly generated terrain. Built on our Mirror Engine, Animal Armies shows that the engine can be adapted from a game of adventure to a game of turn based strategy.
