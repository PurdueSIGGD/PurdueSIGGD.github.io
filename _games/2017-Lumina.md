<!--Put description here:-->
Lumina was the Spring-Fall 2017 game! It was our first challenge with a fully 3D first-person game, using procedurally generated dungeons and incorporating a lot of 3D assets.

The goal is to clear out as many dungeons as possible, and equip the best loot! With more dungeons cleared, you can fight more challenging enemies and upgrade your weapons and stats even further.

Give it a shot, and try your best to survive in the harsh world of Lumina!
