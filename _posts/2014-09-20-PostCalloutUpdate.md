We had a good turnout from the ACM callout!  About 10-15 new members joined, possibly more, and they all seem eager to sink their teeth into the project.
  Thursday, Unreal Engine 4 was not installed yet on the computers, so I talked about various aspects of the club as well as answered many of their questions.  
  Today, UE4 was installed on half of the computers, so we had to improvise.  Everybody got experience in Unreal by playing around with various templates and assets
  of UE4.  Tuesday, we will start giving tasks to the rookies and plunge them into game development!
