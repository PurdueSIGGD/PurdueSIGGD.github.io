After a couple of years, the "About Us" photo needed an update.  Most of the people in the old photo graduated and are doing 
things in their jobs.  So here we are, a smaller group with a few stragglers that came in after the photo, but still strong at
developing games.

In other news related to games, I contacted a fair amount of US game companies about helping sponsor members of SIGGD to 
go to the Game Developers Conference in March of 2015.  A few are interested in helping sponsor our trip, most probably sent my email into 
the trash, but there are lots more companies out there to ask.  Just even getting a response shows people are interested in helping young
developers break into the field.  I'm excited.  Are you?
