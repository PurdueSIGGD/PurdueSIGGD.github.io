It’s almost time for the game jam and I’m excited to see it happen!  I have 4 judges as well as sponsorship from Google and the Computer Graphics Tech department here at Purdue.  It’s a small step, but I’m really happy we can now have prizes and food at the jam.  Hopefully attendance will be decent.  I put fliers all over the big student spots on campus, so I hope my efforts have helped get the word out!

There’s still plenty left to do.  Request guest accounts, check to see if the building will be open, go get prizes and food, prep the judges are just the few things to do before the jam.  It’s going to be a crazy week, but it’s going to be so fun at the jam.

Let’s go!
