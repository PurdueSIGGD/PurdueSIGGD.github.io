After missing the Global Game Jam, SIGGD decided to host our own game jam here at Purdue! The venue is set, the time have been chosen, all that's left is to advertise, advertise, advertise! Also, find sponsors.

I have been asking professionals in the industry for support as well as groups on campus for advice and support. So far, I have one judge, a possible sponsorship from ACM, and a couple leads from networking. Hopefully there will be enough support for the jam.

Let's see what happens in a month.
