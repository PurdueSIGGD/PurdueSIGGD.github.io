The SIGGD game jam has officially commenced! We have around 20 participants, all who are eager to win some prizes!

This years theme is: **"Folklore"**! So grab your history books and fairy tales, because this sounds like quite the challenge!

On Saturday, we will have brunch at 10:00 am with fruits and snacks, and dinner at 6:00 pm. Come to hang out with other participants and give some games a shot! Remember, it is a lot easier for a new player to find bugs as opposed to yourself. 

Anyone who has any more questions about the game jam can send emails to [The SIGGD Email](SIGGD.purdue@gmail.com).

Now get jamming!
