SIGGD Will be at the CS 390 VR Open House this thursday! It will be from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm in LWSN B131.

Come try out our latest multiplayer game, Project W! We don't have much to show on the art asset side, but we have two playable characters and a fully fleshed out networking system. Come and check it out, and play with the rest of the team!
