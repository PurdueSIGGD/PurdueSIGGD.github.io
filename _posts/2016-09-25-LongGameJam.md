So we are trying something different this year. Instead of solely doing the tutorial and moving on to work on our game, we are going to have a 3 week long hackathon! It won't be a typical day-to-day hackathon, all meetings will take place as time to work together, and should be enough time to get your game running.

However, that isn't all. The games will include two mystery assets, one for 2D and one for 3D! **You can find the [2D asset here](https://github.com/Lonswaya/SIGGDAssets/blob/master/Swinger2D.prefab?raw=true)** and the **[3D asset here](https://github.com/Lonswaya/SIGGDAssets/blob/master/Swinger3D.prefab?raw=true).** To properly import these prefabs, add them to your "Asset" folder and drag them into the scene inside of the editor.

All games must use at least one of these assets in some way, shape or form. It can be an integral mechanic of the game, or it can simply be a background prop. All it needs to be is visible within the first few minutes of playing the game.

Developers are able to modify the asset only by adding more components to the gameobjects or changing the values of the components. You cannot delete any component or gameobject.

We will demo these on our meeting Thursday, October 20th, and the top winners will have their games hosted on the website. Myself and all other experienced members will be around to answer any questions about unity.

Good luck, everyone!
