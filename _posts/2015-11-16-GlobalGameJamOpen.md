Registration to participate in the Global Game Jam 2016 is now open!  SIGGD is hosting a site this year at Purdue University.  It's open to anyone over 18 years of age.
Anyone.  Students, seasoned veterans, enthusiasts, professional developers, whoever!  Since there's limited space available, I made a form for anyone interested to fill out:

Here's also information about the jam site: http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/purdue-university

Hoping to see a bunch of jammers!
