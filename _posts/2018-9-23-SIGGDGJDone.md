**1st place**, for gamer's headphones with mic: *Explanation*

**2nd place**, for Steam giftcards: *Clocktower*!

**3rd place**, for the Unity/Unreal Textbook collection: *Event Horizon*!

You can find the submissions [**here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRL9HN8z0LXwnLlSadhXGziQoxBXmHZk?usp=sharing)
