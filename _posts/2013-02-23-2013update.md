Its been some time since our last update, but we have not been laxing here at Purdue SIGGD! For the Spring 2013 Semester there are two projects that we are working on.  

Animal Armies, an Animal themed turn based strategy game, and Blob Game, a puzzle platform with an adorable main character!  

This post is for our activities so far in Blob Game and we hope to keep this more regular. Stay Tuned!
