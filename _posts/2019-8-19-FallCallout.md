On Thursday, August 29th and Tuesday, September 3rd at 6:30 PM in LWSN B131, SIGGD will be hosting its Fall callouts! There are 2 different days available, as space is limited, so please only show up for one. The content of both callout meetings will be the same. Please show up and learn more about SIGGD, and find a place in our team!

Also, on Friday, September 27th starting at 6:00 PM, and running until Sunday September 29th at 5:00 PM, in LWSN B151 will be the SIGGD Game Jam! Compete for prizes and spend the weekend making your own game!
