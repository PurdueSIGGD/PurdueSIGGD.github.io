We've had our two call outs, and the results of our first meeting are phenomenal! The two call outs had 100+ students in attendance, and our first Saturday meeting had 40+ new members show. With this huge surge in membership, we're looking for ways to expand our working environment. We're working hard to get the wiki up and moving, as well as developing a curriculum to teach new members about our engine, level editor, and general game programming.  

We've decided to focus on teaching our new members the fundamentals of their team's work for September, while re-evaluating the situation come October to decide whether or not to push for the IGF 2013 deadline of Oct 31st.
