As part of the "New Semester, New Project" initiative of ACM, we have started
our brand new project Space Salvage Game (Internally named as NewSpaceGame).

Keyword-wise our project is a top-down 2D space exploration game. Where you,
Space Dude, is on a space walk salvaging an old wreckage collecting relics and
other lost and forgotten things of the past. Equipped with his trusty wallet and
tether, Space Dude bravely steps out to where no one has gone before.. well 
recently.

In other news, we gained some new members, initiated planning on a GameJam for 
this semester, and will also (hopefully) be demoing our game at BoilerFrag 8.0 
this spring.
