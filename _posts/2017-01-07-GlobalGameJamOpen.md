Registration to participate in the Global Game Jam 2017 is now open!  SIGGD is hosting a site this year at Purdue University.  It's open to anyone over 18 years of age, goes on from January 20th to January 22nd.
Anyone.  Students, seasoned veterans, enthusiasts, professional developers, whoever!  Since there's limited space available, I made a form for anyone interested to fill out:

Hoping to see a bunch of jammers!
