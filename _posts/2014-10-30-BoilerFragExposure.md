SIGGD is going to have a working prototype of Killer Platform (working name) for Purdue University Gamers Group (PUGG)'s
event called BoilerFrag.  BoilerFrag is a big LAN party for gamers on campus.  People come together and games of all sorts for a day.
  This would be a great opportunity to gain more exposure for SIGGD, who we are and what we do, as well as a great opportunity to get feedback on our current project.
  BoilerFrag is in a couple weeks, and we are steadily making progress.
