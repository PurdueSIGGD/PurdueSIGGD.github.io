<!--Put description here:-->
You are a helicopter. A small, worthless, piece of shit helicopter. But you wanna get better, you wanna get bigger. But you have to start small. Protect your base from missiles. You don't have any weapons yourself so use your helicopter body to block the missiles. If the bases, which share the same health, drop down to 0 health, game over (without a game over state).
