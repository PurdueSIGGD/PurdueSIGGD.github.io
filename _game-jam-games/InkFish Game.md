<!--Put description here:-->
In “Inkfish Game”, you control a small squid who dreams of escaping its tank. To grow, eat fish that are smaller than you. The squid you control doesn’t move at a constant speed, so make sure to time the movement correctly, otherwise you’ll be lunch! If you’re looking for a change of pace from pixel art or 3D games, our game is made entirely from digital art with a very simplified art style.
