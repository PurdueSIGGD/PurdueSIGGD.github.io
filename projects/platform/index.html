        	Killer Platform was a project during the first semester of 2014. It was our first attempt with the Unreal engine, which used an experimental 2D method.
        	We did downsize during the development during the game, limiting our progress made during that time.
        	Killer Platform was an alternative method of platformers where instead of being walked on all the time, you were the one who took control and rebelled against the players.
