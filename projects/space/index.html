    	    Space Game is SIGGD and GDU's project for the Fall 2013 semester. Drawing from a wonderful mix between the earlier classics of Missile Defense and Asteroids,
        Space Game revolves around using orbital mechanics to defend a planet from invading aliens.
    	    The game is currently being developed with the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity Game Engine</a>, presented in a top-down 2.5D perspective.
