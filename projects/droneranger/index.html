        	The Drone Ranger was the Fall 2018-Spring 2019 game! It was challenging for us this year, as we were mostly new members of SIGGD, but we made a fun game that we're all proud of.
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal is to fight your way past bandits and robots, and save the future! The further you go, the better weapons you'll come across, improving your futuristic arsenal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Draw! And do your best to fight your way through this wild-west/sci-fi game!
        </p>
