<!--Put description here:-->

Andrew Hanlon is a junior who’s majoring in Biomedical Health Sciences with a Pre-Med concentration. This is his third year in SIGGD and first year on the leadership staff. He’s always had a love for video games and has been working to develop his musical and programming skills during his time in the club. While someday working in the field of medicine is his big focus, he is hopeful that game development can be a hobby for him in the future.
